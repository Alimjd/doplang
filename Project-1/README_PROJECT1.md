# About Project-1
- This project contains the initial design for the language, a lexical analyzer, and a txt file that includes 5 different examples written in doplang.
- The language was designed according to the project assignment discussed below.
- More information about the language is available in the report.

### The Assignment
The assignment was to design a programming language for drones. To quote the assignment text from the [CS 315 webpage](http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~guvenir/courses/CS315/), the project included:

"First, you will give a name to your language and design its syntax. Note that the best way to hand in your design is its grammar in BNF form, followed by a description of each of your language components. The following is a list of features required in your language:
- variable identifiers
- assignment operator
- precedence, associativity of the operators
- expressions (arithmetic, relational, boolean, their combination)
- loops
- conditional statements
- statements for input / output
- function definitions and function calls.
- comments

and, primitive functions for
- reading the inclination of the drone
- reading the altitude
- reading the temperature
- reading the acceleration
- turning on/off video camera
- taking pictures with video camera
- reading current timestamp from timer
- connecting to the base computer through wi-fi"
