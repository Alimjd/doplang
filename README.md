# doplang

## What is doplang?
It is a programming language that is developed and optimized for programming drones. It stands for "**d**rone **o**riented **p**rogramming **lang**uage".

## CS 315 Course & Format of the Repo
This language was created as a project for Bilkent University's CS 315 Programming Languages course, Fall 2020-2021 semester. The language was created in 2 separate legs (as 2 projects). [Project 1](Project-1) involved the initial design of the language according to the project assignment, a lexical analyzer and a report detailing the the full BNF and specific constructs and conventions associatiated with the language, as well as an evaluation of the language in terms of readability and writability. [Project 2](Project-2) includes an updated version of the lexical analyzer as well as the report, and a parser for the language. Each project directory with the repository has its individual readme, detailing the contents of the project as well.

## Creators
Creators of this language are Burak Yiğit Uslu [@burakyuslu](https://github.com/burakyuslu), and Emre Açıkgöz [@emrez](https://github.com/emrez). We were the group 52 in the semester we took the course.

## A Bit More About The Language
This programming language aims to be easy to write and read. In general, it is much closer to natural languages than most of the popular programming languages. 
It covers all of the basic functionalities required for programming a drone. doplang was designed with the purpose of being an easy-to-learn drone programming language in mind, and the design decisions for the language also reflect this.
More about the design and the conventions of the language can be seen via the report.

## Notes
- This language does not have a compiler (yet). It has BNF, and a lexical analyzer as well as a parser based on the BNF, however, as it was not reqired for the CS 315 course, no compiler was created for this language. It may be added in the future.
